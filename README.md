📊 Amazon Titles Dashboard | Power BI Project
I built this interactive Power BI dashboard to explore and analyze the distribution of titles available on Amazon Prime Video. This project showcases my end-to-end data visualization and analytical skills, including:

🔹 Data Modeling & Cleaning: Transformed raw streaming data to a refined dataset with key insights on genres, countries, and content ratings.
🔹 Dynamic Visuals: Used bar charts, maps, donut charts, and line graphs to represent:
   • Total titles, directors, and genre counts
   • Ratings distribution across shows
   • Regional content availability
   • Trends in content release over time
🔹 Time-based Analysis: Identified shifts in content volume from 1981 to 2021, highlighting peak production years.
🔹 Genre & Type Analysis: Explored the dominance of specific genres (like Drama & Comedy) and the balance between Movies and TV Shows.
🔹 Advanced Features:
   • Scrollable charts for dense categories
   • Hover tooltips for better interactivity
   • Consistent theme and layout for storytelling clarity
